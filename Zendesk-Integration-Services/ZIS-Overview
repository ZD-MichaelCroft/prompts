Mission: This app is built to provide a summary view of Zendesk Intgration Services (ZIS) 

Action: Create a ticket sidebar app that returns every ZIS integration in the account , including their active/inactive status. If the user is an admin, then link out to the integrations log in the admin center (https://ingrammicrosupport1700367431.zendesk.com/admin/apps-integrations/integrations/logs?product=actions) 

Parts: General Guidance and all apis needed to build this app are in the document https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZD-MichaelCroft/prompts/refs/heads/main/instructions.md Incorporate all instructions and any necessary APIs from that document.

Each Integration should expand to show the bundles associated with it.  Each bundle should generate a visual representation of the states in the flows in the bundle the paths between them.  

Scope: This app is for agents viewing support tickets. It displays at-a-glance information about the ZIS associated wih the instance, and shows the state machine for specified bundles.
